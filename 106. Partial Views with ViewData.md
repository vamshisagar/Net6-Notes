- ðŸ”„ Static Content Issue:
  - Every invocation of partial view repeats static content.
- ðŸ“Š Dynamic Content Solution:
  - Supply dynamic data to partial view using ViewData object.
  - ViewData copy sent to partial view, not original.
- ðŸ”„ Data Update Clarification:
  - Changes in partial view's ViewData don't reflect in main view.
- ðŸ“‘ Implementation:
  - In HomeController/Index:
    - ViewData["ListTitle"] = "Cities".
    - ViewData["ListItems"] = List<string> with city names.
  - Invoke partial view with updated ViewData for dynamic data.
- ðŸ“‹ Partial View Invocation:
  - Receives copy of supplied ViewData.
  - Can modify data locally without affecting main view.
- ðŸŽ­ Specific ViewData:
  - Create separate ViewData object for partial view with specific keys.
  - Partial view reads only keys from supplied specific ViewData object.
- ðŸŽ¯ Strongly Typed Partial View:
  - Next lecture will explore making partial view strongly typed.
