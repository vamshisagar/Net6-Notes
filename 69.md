- 💼 Introduction to View Data vs. View Bag:
  - When retrieving values from view data, typecasting is required based on the type.
  - Single object requires conversion into the model class type, while a collection needs to be cast as a list.
- 🎒 Introduction of View Bag:
  - View bag is introduced as a predefined property to simplify data access.
  - It allows direct access without explicit typecasting, saving coding effort.
- 🔄 View Bag Functionality:
  - View bag serves as a property of the controller and view, similar to view data.
  - Values can be assigned in the controller and accessed in the view.
- 🧹 Simplified Syntax:
  - View bag syntax simplifies data access compared to view data, using dot notation instead of square brackets and quotes.
  - Offers cleaner and more straightforward code.
- 🔍 Internal Workings:
  - View bag internally depends on view data, serving as a syntactical sugar.
  - Dynamic typing allows flexibility but lacks compiler control over types.
- 🚧 Handling Null Values:
  - View bag returns null if a property doesn't exist, which can cause issues when accessing properties.
  - Use of the "?" operator helps avoid null reference exceptions, particularly with nullable types.
- 🔄 Working with View Bag:
  - View bag can be used for both assigning and retrieving data in the controller.
  - It shares the same data storage as view data, allowing interchangeability.
- 🤝 Coexistence of View Data and View Bag:
  - Both view data and view bag can be utilized interchangeably, offering developers flexibility in coding preferences.
  - They access the same source of data, enabling seamless integration and usage in views and controllers.
