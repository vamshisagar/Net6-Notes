- 📝 Model binding allows reading request headers easily.
- 📥 Inputs from request include form fields, request body (JSON or XML), router data, query string, and request headers.
- 🖋 Traditional method involves accessing headers through controller context or HTTP context.
- 🎯 Model binding simplifies header retrieval using attribute declaration.
- 🛠 Declare a string parameter with `[FromHeader]` attribute specifying the header key.
- 🔄 Value is automatically populated at runtime based on the specified key.
- 🌐 Example: Retrieving "User-Agent" request header.
- 🖥 User-Agent contains browser details.
- 🔄 Example demonstrates receiving User-Agent value in response.
- 🚀 In real-world projects, request headers are important but rarely directly accessed.
