- 💡 Model binding overview:
  - Model binding involves handling form fields, route data, and query string parameters.
  - Form fields can be form url encoded or form data.

- 📄 Content types and request body:
  - Content types include JSON, CSV, and XML.
  - Other than form data and form url encoded, content types like JSON or XML require using the request body.
  - Request body model binding includes JSON, XML, or custom formats.

- 📝 Using `FromBody` attribute:
  - Use `FromBody` attribute for model parameters to parse JSON or XML data into model objects.
  - Example: Sending JSON data via Postman requires selecting "raw" body and enabling input formatter.

- 🔄 Enabling JSON input formatter:
  - Enable JSON input formatter by using `FromBody` attribute.
  - This allows parsing JSON data into the specified model object.

- 📥 Testing JSON data:
  - After enabling `FromBody`, JSON data sent via Postman can be properly received and parsed into the model object.
  - Example: Person's name, email, and phone number can be included in JSON format.
