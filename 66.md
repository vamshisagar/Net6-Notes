- 💡 Custom Validation Attributes:
  - When built-in validation attributes like required or range don't meet your needs, you create custom validation code.
  - Custom validation is implemented through custom validation attributes, which are classes inheriting from the base class `ValidationAttribute`.
  - The actual validation logic resides in the overridden `IsValid` method, which is automatically called during model validation.
  - Within the `IsValid` method, you define your validation rules and return either `ValidationResult.Success` or a validation error message.
  - Parameters in `IsValid` include the property value to be validated and a validation context providing additional details.
- 🛠 Implementation Steps:
  - Create a custom validation attribute class inheriting from `ValidationAttribute`.
  - Override the `IsValid` method to define validation logic based on your requirements.
  - Apply the custom validation attribute to the model property in your code.
  - During runtime, the `IsValid` method is invoked automatically as part of the model validation process.
  - Return either `ValidationResult.Success` or a validation error message based on the validation outcome.
- 📝 Error Message Handling:
  - Error messages can be customized in custom validation attributes.
  - By supplying an error message in the attribute declaration, you override the default error message.
  - You can also provide a default error message within the custom attribute class, which is used if no specific error message is provided.
- 🔄 Dynamically Configurable:
  - Parameters in custom validation attributes can be dynamically configured.
  - By passing parameters through the attribute constructor, you make the validation rules adaptable.
  - This allows for flexibility in setting validation criteria based on runtime conditions or model properties.
- 🔁 Reusability:
  - Custom validation attributes enhance reusability across multiple model properties.
  - Once defined, they can be applied to any applicable model property, promoting code efficiency and consistency.
  - This reusability simplifies maintenance and ensures consistent validation logic throughout the application.
