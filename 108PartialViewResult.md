🔄 Purpose of returning partial views from controller:

- Returning partial views for asynchronous requests made from the browser.

- Facilitating asynchronous loading of information without refreshing the full page.

⚙️ Process overview:

- Browser makes an asynchronous request using JavaScript (e.g., XML HTTP request or Fetch API).

- Controller action method receives the asynchronous request, creates a model object, and passes it to the partial view.

- Partial view executes on the server side, executing server-side code (e.g., C#).

- Executed content of the partial view, typically HTML, is sent as a response to the browser.

🔧 Implementation steps:

- Controller returns a partial view result, specifying the view name and model object.

- Alternatively, a shortcut method `return PartialView(viewName, model)` is available.

- JavaScript code asynchronously fetches content from the server based on user interaction.

- Content received from the server is dynamically rendered on the page without page refresh.

🛠️ Implementation example:

- Creation of a button in the view triggers JavaScript function.

- JavaScript function makes an asynchronous request to the controller.

- Controller action method processes the request, executes the partial view, and returns the HTML content.

- HTML content is dynamically added to the page using JavaScript.

👩‍💻 Real-world application:

- Useful for loading additional content on demand, such as orders in an e-commerce application.

- Enables dynamic loading of content without page refresh, enhancing user experience.

- Content can be fetched from databases using technologies like Entity Framework for real-time updates.
