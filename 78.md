- 💻 ASP.NET Core View Basics:
  - The view in ASP.NET Core serves as a web page responsible for design and presentation logic.
  - Presentation logic can be in HTML (client-side) or C# (server-side).
  - HTML code is considered client-side, while C# code is server-side.
  - C# code executes on the server before HTML executes on the browser.
  - A view is invoked by the controller, which sends a ViewModel object to it.
- 🎯 Controller Responsibilities:
  - The controller creates and fills a ViewModel object with necessary values for output.
  - It doesn't generate actual output but passes the ViewModel to the view.
  - Based on parameters like route or database data, the controller decides which view to execute.
- 🔄 View-Controller Interaction:
  - The view accesses ViewModel properties directly, populating the presentation with data.
  - Depending on route parameters, different views can be invoked.
  - Views are organized in folders, typically named after their corresponding controllers.
- 🚀 Setting Up ASP.NET Core:
  - Setting up an ASP.NET Core project involves configuring controllers and views as services.
  - Controllers and views are instantiated at runtime when a request is made.
- 🖥️ Writing Views:
  - Views are HTML pages containing both server-side (C#) and client-side (HTML) code.
  - C# code executes first, followed by HTML on the browser.
  - Views are located in the "Views" folder, organized by controller names.
- 🛠️ Creating a Basic View:
  - To create a view, add a new Razor view with the appropriate name.
  - Views typically contain HTML markup for the user interface.
  - Browser Link in Visual Studio aids in automatic page refreshing during development.
- 🔍 Debugging Views:
  - Views are debugged by inspecting the generated HTML code in the browser.
  - Server-side code is executed first, generating HTML that is then sent to the browser for rendering.
- 📝 Further Learning:
  - In-depth learning about writing C# code within views will be covered in subsequent lectures.
